        <h3>About the moive : </h3>
        <p>Batman Begins is a 2005 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan. It stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman, as well as Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, and Cillian Murphy, among others. The film is a reboot of the Batman film franchise and explores the origins of the character, including Bruce Wayne's journey to become Batman and his initial battles with the villains of Gotham City.

            Batman Begins takes a darker and more grounded approach to the character, drawing on elements of film noir and crime dramas to tell its story. The film received positive reviews for its atmosphere, performances, and reimagining of the character, and is widely regarded as one of the best superhero films ever made. The film was followed by two sequels, "The Dark Knight" (2008) and "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012), which together form the "Dark Knight Trilogy".</p>
