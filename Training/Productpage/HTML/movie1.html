        <h3>About the moive : </h3>
        <p>The Batman is a superhero movie directed by Matt Reeves and released in 2021. 
            The film features Robert Pattinson as the titular character, 
            Bruce Wayne/Batman, and focuses on his early days as the Caped Crusader. The movie 
            takes a noir-driven approach to the character, as Batman investigates a series of crimes in Gotham City and faces off 
            against some of the city's most notorious villains, including the Riddler (played by Paul Dano) and Catwoman 
            (played by Zoe Kravitz). 
            The film received positive reviews for its gritty tone and strong performances, 
            particularly from Pattinson as the Dark Knight.</p>
